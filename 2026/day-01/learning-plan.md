# 90-Day DevOps Learning Plan

## Current Level
I am a student with beginner-level knowledge of DevOps and Cloud Computing. I am currently learning DSA and Web Development alongside DevOps.

## My Understanding of DevOps & Cloud
DevOps is a culture and set of practices that help development and operations teams work together to deliver software faster and more reliably using automation, CI/CD, containers, and cloud platforms.  
Cloud computing provides scalable infrastructure and services that allow applications to be deployed, monitored, and managed efficiently.

## Why I Am Learning DevOps & Cloud
I am learning DevOps to become industry-ready, secure a job in a good company, and build a stable career so I can fulfill my personal goals and support my family.

## 90-Day Goals
1. Build and deploy a Dockerized web application using a CI/CD pipeline  
2. Learn Kubernetes basics and deploy an application on a cluster  
3. Create at least one real-world DevOps project and share it on GitHub and LinkedIn  

## Core DevOps Skills to Build
1. Linux & basic troubleshooting  
2. CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions / Jenkins)  
3. Containerization & orchestration (Docker & Kubernetes)  

## Time Commitment
- Weekdays: 1 hour per day  
- Weekends: 2–3 hours per day  
I will balance DevOps with DSA and Web Development without burning out.

## Consistency Plan
I will study DevOps daily, track my progress publicly through #90DaysOfDevOps, and focus on consistency over perfection throughout the 90-day journey.
